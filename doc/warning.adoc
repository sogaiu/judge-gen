= Warning

The automation portion of this project involves generating test files
from source files.  In order to keep these up-to-date, the generation
process erases the directory that files are copied / generated into
(as well as the content of the directory).

Please don't use this tool without source control or something that
provides adequate protection from data loss.  Thanks!
