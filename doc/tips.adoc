= Usage / Test Writing Tips

* Use `'()` or `[]` instead of `()` in some places to express return
  values, e.g.
+
[source,janet]
----
# => '(:hi 1)
----
or:
+
[source,janet]
----
# => [:hi 1]
----
+
not:
+
[source,janet]
----
# => (:hi 1)
----

* More than one expression + expected value info pair can be placed in
  a comment block.  For example, in the following:
+
[source,janet]
----
(comment

  (+ 1 1)
  # => 2

  (- 1 1)
  # => 0

)
----
+
two tests will be created and executed.

* It's also fine to put other forms in the comment block that don't
  have expected value info appearing after them, all such forms will
  be included in tests.  For example, in the following:
+
[source,janet]
----
(comment

  (def a 1)

  (+ a 1)
  # => 2

)
----
+
`(def a 1)` will be executed during testing.

* However, if a comment block has no tests (i.e. no expected values
  indicated), the forms within the comment block will NOT be executed.
  Thus, for the following:
+
[source,janet]
----
(comment

  (print "hi")

)
----
+
since there are no expected values indicated, `(print "hi")` will
NOT be executed.
