# LIMITS:
#
# * doesn't handle code that is not "well-formed"
#
# * newlines after comment blocks are currently considered part of the
#   identified comment block, this affects the searching for target
#   comment blocks.  to avoid including a comment block as a target,
#   place the cursor beyond the last non-whitespace character that
#   counts as part of the comment block (should be a closing paren)
#
# * likely only works with utf-8

# POSSIBILITIES:
#
# * identify each test by the line number its definition begins on
#   in the source file.
#
# * jg-verdict's --debug flag should lead to jg's --debug flag being
#   enabled?
#
# * support non-absolute paths for arguments to jg-verdict
#
# * merge jg and jg-verdict executables -- one benefit is disk space
#   reduction (currently 500kb * 2)
#
# * in handle_one, instead of `(break false)`, perhaps different
#   values could be returned to indicate different types of errors
#
# * consider different reporting modes for jg.  concrete examples:
#
#   * for earliest / quickest feedback, have _verify output info as soon
#     as it is available
#
#   * for slower feedback, have _verify just pass back all test
#     results at the end when they are all ready
#
#   different receivers might be set up for handling test results, but
#   this may be getting too elaborate at this stage :)
#
# * produce code with comment blocks unwrapped inline -- test context is
#   is more likely to be correct than just appending tests after original
#   code
#
# * could have option to send code to janet -k before main jg processing.
#   atm, `janet -k` doesn't appear to work for files that have
#   `(import ...)` in them, so this may not be an option.
#
# * jg could try to only parse not too far beyond current cursor location
#
# * consider various "rewriting" targets, e.g. testament
#
# * conversion of these types of "tests" to external files to
#   "transition" when things have solidifed enough

# ISSUES:
#
# * how to handle rather large return values -- load from external file?
#
# * how / whether to try to test output (such as from `print`)
#
# * consider using :s instead of :ws in pegs, also in janet-peg-grammar
#
# * :fresh true is used for the project .janet files, is this a concern?

# QUESTIONS:
#
# * is the output from jg rewrite really jdn?  will it always be serializable /
#   deserializable?
