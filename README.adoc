= judge-gen - Generate and Run Tests from Usage Examples
:toc:

== Aims

* Make simple testing low-cost and automatable especially during
  exploratory coding when using Janet.

* Encourage the creation of illustrative examples to help potential users
  form appropriate mental models.

== Status and Warnings

This is an early stage project.  The author uses it in a number of
projects though.  Be sure to examine the link:doc/warning.adoc[fine print].

== How

* Within `comment` blocks, put expressions / forms to be tested along
  with brief records of expected values:
+
[source,janet]
----
(comment

  (- 1 1)
  # => 0

)
----
+
Note the use of a single line comment and `=>` to express an
expected return value.
+
One might call the form + expected value comment a "comment block
test".
+
See link:doc/tips.adoc[Usage / Test Writing Tips] for more details.

* Once some setup steps are followed, tests can be run by: `jpm test`

== Setup

0. Decide on a name for the directory to hold comment block tests,
   e.g. `examples`.
1. Copy the file `test/judge-gen.janet` from this repository to the
   target project's `test` subdirectory and rename it to
   `examples.janet`.
3. If it doesn't exist already, create a direct subdirectory of the project
   root directory named `examples` to house comment block tests.
4. If the `examples` directory doesn't have at least one file with a comment
   block test in it, do something about that :)

See link:doc/details.adoc[Details] for additional information regarding the
various files and directories.

== Usage

To run the tests and get a report: `jpm test`

Add more tests / examples by creating more comment block tests in
files that live in an appropriate directory.
